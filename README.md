## 🔧 Key Components

### Backend (Python)

- **app.py**: Main Chainlit application with chat handlers and Gemini integration
- **system_prompt.py**: Contains prompts that shape the AI's personality and responses

### Frontend (React & CSS)

- **SymptomChecker.jsx**: Multi-step wizard component for collecting symptom and health information
- **custom.css**: Custom styling for the Chainlit UI

## 💻 Symptom Checker Flow

The symptom checker guides users through a 4-step process:

1. **Body Area Selection**: User selects relevant body areas affected
2. **Symptom Selection**: User identifies specific symptoms for each selected body area
3. **Personal Information**: Collection of relevant health data like age, height, weight
4. **Review & Submit**: User reviews all entered information before submission

## 🔄 How It Works

1. When a user starts a chat session, they're presented with the symptom checker
2. The user can either use the symptom checker or ask questions directly
3. If using the symptom checker, the collected data is processed and analyzed
4. The Gemini AI model generates a tailored response with possible causes, recommendations, and guidance
5. For direct questions, the AI responds based on the gynecology-focused system prompt

## 🛠️ Customization

### Modifying the Symptom Checker

- Body areas
- Symptoms for each area
- Personal information fields
- UI elements and styling

### Customizing AI Responses
